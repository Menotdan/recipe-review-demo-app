# Recipe Reviews Demo App

This is a simple app made with Vite+React.js (frontend), and Django (backend). It was built as a technical demonstration for an interview. It features a simple pizza recipe I use at home, and an interactive system to add reviews to the recipe that can be liked.

## Instructions:
To start a development server, in a terminal, `cd` into the `backend` folder. Then, run `python manage.py makemigrations`, `python manage.py migrate` and `python manage.py runserver` to start the backend server.

Next, in another terminal, `cd` into the `frontend` folder. Then, run `npm install` and `npm run dev` to start the frontend server.

Now, you can visit the app at the URL displayed in the frontend terminal.
